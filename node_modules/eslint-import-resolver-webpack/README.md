# eslint-import-resolver-webpack

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/eslint-import-resolver-webpack.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-import-resolver-webpack)

Webpack-literate module resolution plugin for [`eslint-plugin-import`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import).

Published separately to allow pegging to a specific version in case of breaking
changes.

Will look for `webpack.config.js` as a sibling of the first ancestral `package.json`,
or a `config` parameter may be provided with another filename/path either relative to the
`package.json`, or a complete, absolute path.

```yaml
---
settings:
  import/resolver: webpack  # take all defaults
```

or with explicit config file name:

```yaml
---
settings:
  import/resolver:
    webpack: { config: 'webpack.dev.config.js' }
```
